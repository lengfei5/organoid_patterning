# Neuronal tube organoid pattering

There are two main parts:

## Prepare the data to identify nodes, potential network topology, perturbation response in the RD system:
- RNA-seq data and TM3 data
- Downstream image analysis from Hannah's segmentation analysis

## RD simulation
The whole pattern formation process can be roughly divided into three phases:
- heteogeneity generation
- salt-and-pepper (pattern amplification in mouse organoid and not clear in human organoid)
- pattern selection

Now we focus on the late stage of pattern selection:
The RD model requires:
- specify the network topogly
- parameter sampling
- identify the turing parameter spaces
- ID and 2D simulation with turing parameters
- test perturbation
